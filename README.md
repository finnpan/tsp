## GA-EAX
GA with Edge Assembly Crossover is powerful to solve TSP.
I am trying to rewrite some codes to improve readability, for example,
using two-level-tree class to replace amounts of c-array.

The codes of crossover are complicate, so it will take me more time to rewrite.
In addition, I remove some features, such as: entropy of diversity preservation
and Block2, because they are not the core of EAX and make rewriting more complicate.

## CLK
Chained Lin-Kernighan is an efficient implementation of Lin-Kernighan algorithm.
For personal study use, I copy the code from:
'https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/codes/src/co031219.tgz',
written by: Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal, and Cook.
